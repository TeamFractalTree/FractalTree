# About JavaScript
Learn how and why to use JavaScript in the industry

## History
JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape (a very old browser company). 
Despite its name, JavaScript is quite different from Java. Modern JavaScript isn't technically called JavaScript, it's real name is ECMAScript.
However, for simplicity we will refer to it as JavaScript from now on.

## Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is crucial for both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, it enhances user experiences by enabling dynamic content and interactive features, such as real-time updates and animations. On the backend, environments like Node.js allow JavaScript to build efficient server-side applications, making it an essential tool for full-stack development.
