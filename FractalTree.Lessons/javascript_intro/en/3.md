# Variables, Syntax, and Comments

A variable in programming is a container that holds a specific value, that may or may not change. Variables are necessary for any program you are creating, so it is essential you understand the different types of variables and when to use them.


## Statements
a statement in programming is a programming instruction that tells the computer what to do. Declaring and initializing a variable is a type of statement.

Statements are composed of:

- values
- operators
- expressions
- keywords
- comments

Semicolons seperate statements from each other.

To declare variables, JavaScript uses `var`, `const`, and `let`. An equal sign is used to assign values to your variable. 

Example:

```js
let foo, bar, sum; // declaring a variable -- setting up the container.
foo = 90; // place the value 90 into the container 'foo'
bar = 22; // place the value 22 into the container 'bar'
sum = foo + bar; // add the values of foo and bar together and place the value in the container 'sum'. 
console.log(sum) // prints out the value of sum to the console. much easier than typing foo + bar, right?
```
The green highlighted text is what is known as a comment. It is text that the computer ignores, and is written for other people who are reading your code to understand it better. it's also helpful for when you want to come back to a project after a long time of not working on it. Comments make your life and others' easier. 

To create a single-line comment, use `// text`. To create a multi-line comment, use:

```js
/* comment
is 
multiline
how fun
*/
```

The example above from earlier also uses JavaScript Operators, like arithmetic operators:

- `+` to add
- `-` to subtract
- `*` to multiply
- `/` to divide.

here's an example of all the different arithmetic operators used together: 
```js

let a, b, c, d, e;
a = 4 + 2;
b = a - 3;
c = b * a;
d = c / 2;
e = a + b + c + d;
console.log(e);
```

### Const vs. let
Variables with const cannot be redeclared or ressaigned. This may be helpful when you want a constant that cannot be mutable. 

const variables are capitalized to seperate them from mutable variables. 
Example:

```js
// hooke's law:
const K = 50;
let d = 2;
let springForce = -(K * d);

console.log(springForce);
```
const variablse CANNOT be assigned like this:

```js
const K;
K = 50;
```
it must be assigned and declared on the same line.

Use CONST when you declare a new object,  function, or array.
