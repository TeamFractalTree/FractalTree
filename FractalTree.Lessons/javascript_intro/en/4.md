# JavaScript Data Types
Learn how to utilize data type in JavaScript

JavaScript has 8 Datatypes:

- Strings
- Numbers
- BigInt
- Booleans
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol
- Objects

Examples of data types:

```javascript

// numbers

let age = 16;
let priceOfHotDogs = 7002832.32;

console.log(age);
console.log(priceOfHotDogs);

// Strings
let name = "jimmy";

console.log(name);

// Booleans

let goodAtFortnite = true;
let goodGrades = false;

console.log(goodAtFortnite);
console.log(goodGrades);

// Object:

const student = {name: "Jim Bob", city: "GenericTown"}

// date object:

const dateToday = new Date("2015-04-14")

```

In programming, data types are an important concept. It is important to know something about the type when using variables.


Without data types, a computer cannot properly use:

```javascript
let x = "jimmy" + 16;

```

JavaScript will treat this example as:

```javascript
let x = "jimmy" + "16";
```

JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results.

Example:

```javascript
let x = "jimmy" + 16 + 4;
console.log(x);

let y = 16 + 4 + "jimmy";
console.log(y);
```


## Dynamic Types

JavaScript uses **dynamic types**, which means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.

Example:

```javascript
let name; // undefined
name = "John Doe"; // string
console.log(name);
name = 40; // number
console.log(name);
```

## JavaScript Strings

Strings are a line of text or series of characters like "Apples" or "Mary Doe". You can use double or single quotes with strings.

```javascript
let x = "apples";
x = 'apples';
```

## JavaScript Numbers 

Numbers can be written with or without decimals. 

Example:

```javascript
let x = 40;
console.log(x);
let y = 40.52;
console.log(y);
```

### BigInt

A bigInt allows for you to hold numbers that are too big for regular integers or floats.

Example:

```javascript
let x = BigInt("1231234565432345432345432345432123");
console.log(x);

```

To find the data type of a variable, you can use the `typeOf` operator.


```javascript
console.log(typeof(1+1));
console.log(typeof("Apples"));
console.log(typeof(true));
```


## JavaScript Arrays and Objects

Arrays hold multiple items that are separated by commas. The following code creates an array of cities.

```javascript

const cities = ["Doha", "Paris", "London"];
```
Objects hold different properties under one variable. Example:


```javascript
const student = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", GPA: 3.95, Grade: 10};
```
We will learn more about arrays later in this course.
