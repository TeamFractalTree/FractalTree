# Basics of JavaScript
Understand the basic concepts of JavaScript

Javascript is used with HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are coding languages that allow you to structure and style websites, while javascript runs more complex, logic-based actions on your website. 

You can call Javascript code by using the `<script>` tag. 

Example:

```html
<p id="example">Coding with HTML...</p>
<script>
    document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = "Programming with JavaScript!";
</script>
```
You can place scripts anywhere in an HTML file -- it could be at the head, body, or any div. Here's an example of the script we made above being used in a standard HTML file.

Try it out!

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <script> 
    
    function changeParagraph() {
        document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = "Programming with JavaScript!";
    }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> programming with javascript is fun! </h1>

    <button type="button" onclick="changeParagraph()">try it out!</button>

    <p id="example">Coding with HTML...</p>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, a function will be called when the user presses on a button, which will change the paragraph text to "programming with JavaScript!"

## Calling JavaScript Code Externally

You can also place scripts in seperate files. For example, the following code can be placed in a different file named `script.js`:

```js
function coolFunction() {
    document.getElementById("cool code").innerHTML = "Programming with JavaScript!";
}
```

To run this code in your `index.html` file, you can place it in the HTML file with the script tag:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
