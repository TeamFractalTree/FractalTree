# Outputting JavaScript
Learn how to output text in JavaScript

So far, we've learned how to output some code with innerHTML, like this:



```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <script> 
    
    function changeParagraph() {
        document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = "Programming with JavaScript!";
    }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> programming with javascript is fun! </h1>

    <button type="button" onclick="changeParagraph()">try it out!</button>

    <p id="example">Coding with HTML...</p>
</body>
</html>
```
However, there are many different ways to output JavaScript code.

One way is to use document.write(), which is helpful for testing out your code. Here is how you can use it in HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

    <h1> cool website! </h1>

    <script>
        document.write(1 + 1); // should equal 2.
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
The addition done in the brackets will show up on the page as 2. 

Another way to show output in JavaScript is with window.alert(). This can be helpful to display data in an alert box.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

    <h1> cool website! </h1>

    <script>
        window.alert(1 + 1); // should equal 2.
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The final way to output data is through console.log(). We will use this as our main way to output data in later lessons. It's helpful for debugging your code, and displays your data in the console or terminal, not on the document. 

Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

    <h1> cool website! </h1>

    <script>
        console.log(1 + 1); // should equal 2.
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
