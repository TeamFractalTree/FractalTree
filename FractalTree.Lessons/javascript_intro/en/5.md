# Functions and Conditionals
Learn about JS functions.

A function in pgoramming is a way to perform a particular task; it can be called in your code as many times as needed.

Functions are helpful for when you want to reuse code.

Example:

```javascript

function product(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

console.log(product(7, 2));
console.log(product(1,2));
console.log(product(-3, 4));

```

Syntax:

1. a function is initially defined by a `function` keyword, followed by the function's name, then parantheses ().
2. In the parentheses, you include the **parameters**. Parameters are used to change the variables when called, like the example above.
3. place the code to be executed inside the curly brackets.

A return statement outputs the code to whereever it was called. When JS reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
