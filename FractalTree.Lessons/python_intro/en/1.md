#  Syntax
Python syntax can get tedious due to indentation. Spaces are important!

When programming in other languages, they're usually in **readability** mode only. However, in the python programming language, indentation is essential.
Example:
```py
if(1 == 1):
    print("Indents are important")
```
Example of an error:
```py
if 10==10:
print("This does not work")
```
