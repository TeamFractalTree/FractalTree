# Syntax
Learn how to indent and use python syntax properly

Python syntax can get tedious due to indentation. Spaces are important!

When programming in other languages, indentation is only for **readability**. However, in the python programming language, indentation is **essential**.
You may use either 2 or 4 spaces to indent your code, but you must keep the spacing consistent.

## Example:

Working code:
```python
if 1 + 1 is 2:
    print("Indents are important")
```
Bad code:
```python
if 1 + 1 is 2:
print("This does not work")
```
