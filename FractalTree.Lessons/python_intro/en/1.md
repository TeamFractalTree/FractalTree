# Syntax
Learn how to indent and use python syntax properly

Python syntax can get tedious due to indentation. Spaces are important!

When programming in other languages, indentation is only for **readability**. However, in the python programming language, indentation is **essential**.
You may use either 2 or 4 spaces to indent your code, but you must keep the spacing consistent.

## Example:

Working code:
```python
if 1 + 1 is 2:
    print("Indents are important")
```
Bad code:
```python
if 1 + 1 is 2:
print("This does not work")
```

## Comments
Comments are used to explain your code to whoever is reading it. The computer ignores the comment when executing the code. 

## Example:

```py
# this is comment, it will not be printed
print("This will be printed!")
```

Multi-line comments can be done by using a multiline string. Python will ignore strings that aren't assigned to anything, meaning it will ignore the string and will count as a comment. 

## Example:

```py
"""
this is a 
multiline
comment. 
"""
print("This will be printed.")
```
