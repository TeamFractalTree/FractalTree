# Numeric Types
Learn how to represent numbers

## What are numeric types?

Numeric Types are a type of data type that is used to represent and manipulate numic values, these can be in the form of whole numbers, integers, and decimals.

## Integers
Integers are represented through the (int) data type that represents whole numbers and integers.

```python
a = 10 # Positive Integers
b = -5 # Negative Integer
c = 0 # Zero
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
```
## Floating points
Represented through the (float) data type, they represent decimal numbers and always have a decimal point.

```python
pi = 3.14
shares = -5.9
print(pi)
print(shares)
```

## Complex Numbers
Representing imaginary numbers, complex is a more unique data type, that can be separated by real and imaginary using the (.real) and (.imag) methods.

```python
imag_function = 3 + 4j
print(imag_function.real)
print(imag_function.imag)
```
