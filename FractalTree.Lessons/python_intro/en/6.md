## Boolean Operators and Values
In programming, especially python, it's important to know if an expression is true or false.
Evaluating a boolean expression in python will only give two answers: True, and False.
Comparing two values will evaluate the expression to a boolean response.

```python
print(12 > 4) # 12 is greater than 4, evaluates to True
print(12 < 4) # 12 is less than 4, evaluates to False
print(12 == 4) # 12 is equal to 4, evaluates to False
print(12 >= 12) # 12 is greater than or equal to 12, evaluates to True
print(12 <= 4) # 12 is less than or equal to 4, evaluates to False
```

## Selection
Selection in python consists of the use of if  statements, which print messages based on whether a condition or parameter is true or false

```python
k = 42
d = 90

if k > d:
  print("k is greater than d") # False condition, will resolve to the else statement
else:
  print("k is not greater than d") # True condition, it will print this string
```

There are more operators such as || and &&, which both compare at least two different conditions.

or is the equivalent to suiting at least 1 condition, so if at least one condition or any other are met, it will evaluate to a true statement, if neither are true, then it will evaluate to false.

and is the equivalent to suiting all conditions, so if all conditions are met, then it will evaluate to true, if not all or neither are met, than it will evaluate to false.

```python

k = 42
d = 90
o = 42
t = 75

print(k >= d or k == o) # k is equal to d or k is equal to o, k is equal to o, so the statement evaluates to True
print(k >= d and k == o) # k is equal to d or k is equal to o, k is equal to o, but k is not greater than or equal to d, since at least both conditions are not met, the statement evaluates to False
print(k == o and t < d) # k is equal to o and t is less than d, so since both conditions are met, this statement evaluates to True

if k <= o and d > t: # Both conditions are met, so this will print 'I love pizza!'
    print("I love pizza!") 
else:
    print("I love burgers!")

if d <= o and t > k: # At least one condition is met, so this will print 'I love ice cream!'
    print("I love ice cream!") 
else:
    print("I love cake!")
```
