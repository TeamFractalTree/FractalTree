# String Manipulation
Learn how to manipulate text

## String Indexes

Strings have an index assigned towards each character that starts from 0 onwards. 

This is used to replicate a range of characters in a given string.

### Slicing
Utilizing a given start and end index will allow to print a specific set of characters in a string.

NOTE: Slicing will result in the printed string to include the starting index but no the ending index

```python
e = "Fractal Tree"
print(e[1:8]) # Will print characters from the 1st index to the 4th index: 'ractal '
```

### Slice from the start 
By leaving out the start index, the range will start from the first character to the designated end index given.

```python
e = "Fractal Tree"
print(e[:3]) # Will print characters from the start to the 5th index: 'Fra'
```

### Slice to the end
By leaving out the end index, the range will start from designated index given to the end of the string.

```python
e = "Fractal Tree"
print(e[3:]) # Will print characters from the 3rd index to the end: 'ctal Tree'
```

## String Modification
Python has built in methods that aid in modifying string values in the process of changing the characters in the string

The upper() method returns all characters in the string in upper case:
```python
f = "Fractal Tree"
print(f.upper()) # Returns 'FRACTAL TREE'
```

The lower() method returns all characters in the string in lower case:
```python
f = "Fractal Tree"
print(f.lower()) # Returns 'fractal tree'
```

The replace() method replaces a string or specific character with another string:
```python
f = "Fractal Tree"
print(f.replace("al","ion")) # Returns 'Fraction Tree'
```
## String Concatenation
Using the + operator, you can concatenate or combine 2 different strings

Merging 2 strings:
```python
g = "Fractal"
h = "Tree"
print(g + h) # Will print 'FractalTree'
```

You can also print extra strings such as spaces between stored variables using the + operator:
```python
g = "Fractal"
h = "Tree"
print(g + " " + h) # Will print 'Fractal Tree'
```
