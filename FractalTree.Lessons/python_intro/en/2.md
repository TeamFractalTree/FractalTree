# Variables
Learn how to create and identify variables

What exactly is a variable? 
Simply put, it's a way to store information. In the case of python, there's no actual function or command to declare a variable. 

Every single time you assign a value to a "word" or "variable" then the variable is created.
Example:
```python
x = 1
print(x)
```
Variables, as you can see, do not need to be declared with any "type". Their "type" can be changed any time.
Example:
```python
x = 1
x "Tree"
print(x)
```
## How can we identify what type of variable are we dealing with?
Well, it's quite simple. We use the **type()** function. There are four variable types that we will be looking at:
* Strings
* Integers
* Floats
* Booleans

## Try it out here:
```python
svar = "Tree"
ivar = 5
fvar = 5.0
bvar = True
print(type(svar))
print(type(ivar))
print(type(fvar))
print(type(bvar))
```
