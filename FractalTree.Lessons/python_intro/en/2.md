# Variables
Learn how to create and identify variables

## What exactly is a variable? 

Simply put, it's a way to store information. In the case of python, there's no actual function or command to declare a variable. 

Every single time you assign a value to a "word" or "variable" then the variable is created.
Example:
```python
x = 1
print(x)
```
Variables, as you can see, do not need to be declared with any "type". Their "type" can be changed any time.
Example:
```python
x = 1
x = "Tree"
print(x)
```
## How can we identify what type of variable are we dealing with?
Well, it's quite simple. We use the **type()** function. There are four variable types that we will be looking at:
* Strings
* Integers
* Floats
* Booleans

## Try it out here:
```python
svar = "Tree"
ivar = 5
fvar = 5.0
bvar = True
print(type(svar))
print(type(ivar))
print(type(fvar))
print(type(bvar))
```


## Variable Names
Naming your variables properly is a good practice, so you can save you and whoever's reading your code time and effort. The general rules for naming variables in python are:

- A variable name has to start with a *letter* or an underscore (it cannot start with a number!)
- It cannot contain any symbols (#@!$%^&*.. etc)
- Variable names are case-sensitive!


Try running these illegal variable names:

```python
qarTo$ = 18.2
3rdmonth = "March"
if = true
third-month = "March"
print(qarTo$)
print(if)
print(3rdmonth)
print(third-month)
```

Example of Case-sensitive variable names:
```python
parkName = "generic park"
ParkName = "generic park 1"
PARKNAME = "generic park 3"
paRKnAmE = "non-generic park"
parkname = "very generic park"

print(parkName)
print(ParkName)
print(PARKNAME)
print(paRKnAmE)
print(parkname)
```
