# Python Context
Upon entering the Introduction to Python course you be a pup but when you exit you'll be a master yielding the secrets of the universe. Good luck!

## What exactly is Python?

Well, it's a popular programming language that released in 1991 by the great individual Guido Van Rossum. You may use Python for web development, software development, mathematics, and data analysis! 

## Why Python?

Python works on virtually every platform and its syntax is as if you're speaking english. This syntax, in particular, permits for new programmers such as yourself to write programs in a significantly lesser amount of lines. Later on in your computer science journey, you'll realize that optimization versus lines in code are NOT linearly associated with each other. However, for simplicity's sake, optimization and complexity will be out of the scope of your learning.

Run your first python statement: :)
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
