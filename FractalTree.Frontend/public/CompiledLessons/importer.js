Modern JavaScript isn't technically called JavaScript, it's real name is ECMAScript.\nHowever, for simplicity we will refer to it as JavaScript from now on.\n\n## Why JavaScript?\nJavaScript is crucial for both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, it enhances user experiences by enabling dynamic content and interactive features, such as real-time updates and animations. On the backend, environments like Node.js allow JavaScript to build efficient server-side applications, making it an essential tool for full-stack development."]};

You may use Python for web development, software development, mathematics, and data analysis! \n\n## Why Python?\n\nPython works on virtually every platform and its syntax is as if you're speaking english. This syntax, in particular, permits for new programmers such as yourself to write programs in a significantly lesser amount of lines. Later on in your computer science journey, you'll realize that optimization versus lines in code are NOT linearly associated with each other. However, for simplicity's sake, optimization and complexity will be out of the scope of your learning.\n\nRun your first python statement: \n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nAs you can see, the \"print\" function will display text to the screen.\nIt's important to encase the text with double quotes \"\", otherwise you will get an error.\nYou will learn more about python's syntax in future lessons.", "# Syntax\nLearn how to indent and use python syntax properly\n\nPython syntax can get tedious due to indentation. Spaces are important!\n\nWhen programming in other languages, indentation is only for **readability**. However, in the python programming language, indentation is **essential**.\nYou may use either 2 or 4 spaces to indent your code, but you must keep the spacing consistent.\n\n## Example:\n\nWorking code:\n```python\nif 1 + 1 is 2:\n    print(\"Indents are important\")\n```\nBad code:\n```python\nif 1 + 1 is 2:\nprint(\"This does not work\")\n```\n\n## Comments\nComments are used to explain your code to whoever is reading it. The computer ignores the comment when executing the code. \n\n## Example:\n\n```py\n# this is comment, it will not be printed\nprint(\"This will be printed!\")\n```\n\nMulti-line comments can be done by using a multiline string. Python will ignore strings that aren't assigned to anything, meaning it will ignore the string and will count as a comment. \n\n## Example:\n\n```py\n\"\"\"\nthis is a \nmultiline\ncomment. \n\"\"\"\nprint(\"This will be printed.\")\n```", "# Variables\nLearn how to create and identify variables\n\n## What exactly is a variable? \n\nSimply put, it's a way to store information. In the case of python, there's no actual function or command to declare a variable. \n\nEvery single time you assign a value to a \"word\" or \"variable\" then the variable is created.\nExample:\n```python\nx = 1\nprint(x)\n```\nVariables, as you can see, do not need to be declared with any \"type\". Their \"type\" can be changed any time.\nExample:\n```python\nx = 1\nx = \"Tree\"\nprint(x)\n```\n## How can we identify what type of variable are we dealing with?\nWell, it's quite simple. We use the **type()** function. There are four variable types that we will be looking at:\n* Strings\n* Integers\n* Floats\n* Booleans\n\n## Try it out here:\n```python\nsvar = \"Tree\"\nivar = 5\nfvar = 5.0\nbvar = True\nprint(type(svar))\nprint(type(ivar))\nprint(type(fvar))\nprint(type(bvar))\n```\n\n\n## Variable Names\nNaming your variables properly is a good practice, so you can save you and whoever's reading your code time and effort. The general rules for naming variables in python are:\n\n- A variable name has to start with a *letter* or an underscore (it cannot start with a number!)\n- It cannot contain any symbols (#@!$%^&*.. etc)\n- Variable names are case-sensitive!\n\n\nTry running these illegal variable names:\n\n```py\nqarTo$ = 18.2\n3rdmonth = \"March\"\nif = true\nthird-month = \"March\"\nprint(qarTo$)\nprint(if)\nprint(3rdmonth)\nprint(third-month)\n```\n\nExample of Case-sensitive variable names:\n```py\nparkName = \"generic park\"\nParkName = \"dilly dallying in generic park\"\nPARKNAME = \"generic park 2\"\npaRKnAmE = \"non-generic park\"\nparkname = \"very generic park\"\n\nprint(parkName)\nprint(ParkName)\nprint(PARKNAME)\nprint(paRKnAmE)\nprint(parkname)\n```\n", "# Numeric Types\nLearn how to represent numbers\n\n## What are numeric types?\n\nNumeric Types are a type of data type that is used to represent and manipulate numic values, these can be in the form of whole numbers, integers, and decimals.\n\n## Integers\nIntegers are represented through the (int) data type that represents whole numbers and integers.\n\n```python\na = 10 # Positive Integers\nb = -5 # Negative Integer\nc = 0 # Zero\nprint(a)\nprint(b)\nprint(c)\n```\n## Floating points\nRepresented through the (float) data type, they represent decimal numbers and always have a decimal point.\n\n```python\npi = 3.14\nshares = -5.9\nprint(pi)\nprint(shares)\n```\n\n## Complex Numbers\nRepresenting imaginary numbers, complex is a more unique data type, that can be separated by real and imaginary using the (.real) and (.imag) methods.\n\n```python\nimag_function = 3 + 4j\nprint(imag_function.real)\nprint(imag_function.imag)\n```", "# Casting\nLearn how to convert between data types\n\n## What is casting?\n\nCasting means to specify the type on a variable, utilizing classes to designate and define data types, including its primitive types.\n\nCasting in python uses constructor functions.\n\nint() - Creates an integer numeral from an integer interal, a float literal (which removes all decimals), or a string literal (provided that the string is a whole number)\n\nfloat() - Creates a float numeral from an integer literal (which adds the .0 decimal points), a float literal, or a string literal (provided that the string constitutes an integer or float)\n\nstr() - Creates a string from a variety of data types, including from an integer interal, a float literal, or a string literal\n\nNOTE: Using int() and float() to cast a non-numerical value will result in an error, str() will result in both numerical and non-numerical values to String values\n\n## int() example\n```python\na = int(8) # a will equal 8\nb = int(12.3) # b will equal 12\nc = int(\"15\") # c will equal 15\nd = int(\"17.56\") # d will equal 17\nf = int(\"Fractal Tree\") # This will result in an error\n```\n\n## float() example\n```python\na = float(8) # a will equal 8.0\nb = float(12.3) # b will equal 12.3\nc = float(\"15\") # c will equal 15.0\nd = float(\"17.56\") # d will equal 17.56\nf = float(\"Fractal Tree\") # This will result in an error\n```\n\n## str() example\n```python\na = str(8) # a will equal '8'\nb = str(12.3) # b will equal '12.3'\nc = str(\"15\") # c will equal '15'\nd = str(\"17.56\") # d will equal '17.56'\nf = str(\"Fractal Tree\") # f will equal 'Fractal Tree'\n```", "# String Manipulation\nLearn how to manipulate text\n\n## String Indexes\n\nStrings have an index assigned towards each character that starts from 0 onwards. \n\nThis is used to replicate a range of characters in a given string.\n\n### Slicing\nUtilizing a given start and end index will allow to print a specific set of characters in a string.\n\nNOTE: Slicing will result in the printed string to include the starting index but no the ending index\n\n```python\ne = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(e:[1:8]) # Will print characters from the 1st index to the 4th index: 'ractal '\n```\n\n### Slice from the start \nBy leaving out the start index, the range will start from the first character to the designated end index given.\n\n```python\ne = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(e[:3]) # Will print characters from the start to the 5th index: 'Fra'\n```\n\n### Slice to the end\nBy leaving out the end index, the range will start from designated index given to the end of the string.\n\n```python\ne = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(e:[3:]) # Will print characters from the 3rd index to the end: 'ctal Tree'\n```\n\n## String Modification\nPython has built in methods that aid in modifying string values in the process of changing the characters in the string\n\nThe upper() method returns all characters in the string in upper case:\n```python\nf = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(f.upper()) # Returns 'FRACTAL TREE'\n```\n\nThe lower() method returns all characters in the string in lower case:\n```python\nf = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(f.lower()) # Returns 'fractal tree'\n```\n\nThe replace() method replaces a string or specific character with another string:\n```python\nf = \"Fractal Tree\"\nprint(f.replace(\"al\",\"ion\")) # Returns 'Fraction Tree'\n```\n## String Concatenation\nUsing the + operator, you can concatenate or combine 2 different strings\n\nMerging 2 strings:\n```python\ng = \"Fractal\"\nh = \"Tree\"\nprint(g + h) # Will print 'FractalTree'\n```\n\nYou can also print extra strings such as spaces between stored variables using the + operator:\n```python\ng = \"Fractal\"\nh = \"Tree\"\nprint(g + \" \" + h) # Will print 'Fractal Tree'\n```", "# Booleans and Logical Operators\nLearn how to represent true and false values\n\n## Boolean Operators and Values\nIn programming, especially python, it's important to know if an expression is true or false.\nEvaluating a boolean expression in python will only give two answers: True, and False.\nComparing two values will evaluate the expression to a boolean response.\n\n```python\nprint(12 > 4) # 12 is greater than 4, evaluates to True\nprint(12 < 4) # 12 is less than 4, evaluates to False\nprint(12 == 4) # 12 is equal to 4, evaluates to False\nprint(12 >= 12) # 12 is greater than or equal to 12, evaluates to True\nprint(12 <= 4) # 12 is less than or equal to 4, evaluates to False\n```\n\n## Selection\nSelection in python consists of the use of if  statements, which print messages based on whether a condition or parameter is true or false\n\n```python\nk = 42\nd = 90\n\nif k > d:\n  print(\"k is greater than d\") # False condition, will resolve to the else statement\nelse:\n  print(\"k is not greater than d\") # True condition, it will print this string\n```\n\nThere are more operators such as || and &&, which both compare at least two different conditions.\n\nor is the equivalent to suiting at least 1 condition, so if at least one condition or any other are met, it will evaluate to a true statement, if neither are true, then it will evaluate to false.\n\nand is the equivalent to suiting all conditions, so if all conditions are met, then it will evaluate to true, if not all or neither are met, than it will evaluate to false.\n\n```python\n\nk = 42\nd = 90\no = 42\nt = 75\n\nprint(k >= d or k == o) # k is equal to d or k is equal to o, k is equal to o, so the statement evaluates to True\nprint(k >= d and k == o) # k is equal to d or k is equal to o, k is equal to o, but k is not greater than or equal to d, since at least both conditions are not met, the statement evaluates to False\nprint(k == o and t < d) # k is equal to o and t is less than d, so since both conditions are met, this statement evaluates to True\n\nif k <= o and d > t: # Both conditions are met, so this will print 'I love pizza!'\n    print(\"I love pizza!\") \nelse:\n    print(\"I love burgers!\")\n\nif d <= o and t > k: # At least one condition is met, so this will print 'I love ice cream!'\n    print(\"I love ice cream!\") \nelse:\n    print(\"I love cake!\")\n```\n"]};
