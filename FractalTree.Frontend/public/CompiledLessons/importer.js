Modern JavaScript isn't technically called JavaScript, it's real name is ECMAScript.\nHowever, for simplicity we will refer to it as JavaScript from now on.\n\n## Why JavaScript?\nJavaScript is crucial for both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, it enhances user experiences by enabling dynamic content and interactive features, such as real-time updates and animations. On the backend, environments like Node.js allow JavaScript to build efficient server-side applications, making it an essential tool for full-stack development."]};

Good luck!\n\n## What exactly is Python?\n\nWell, it's a popular programming language that released in 1991 by the great individual Guido Van Rossum. You may use Python for web development, software development, mathematics, and data analysis! \n\n## Why Python?\n\nPython works on virtually every platform and its syntax is as if you're speaking english. This syntax, in particular, permits for new programmers such as yourself to write programs in a significantly lesser amount of lines. Later on in your computer science journey, you'll realize that optimization versus lines in code are NOT linearly associated with each other. However, for simplicity's sake, optimization and complexity will be out of the scope of your learning.\n\nRun your first python statement: :)\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```", "#  Syntax\nPython syntax can get tedious due to indentation. Spaces are important!\n\nWhen programming in other languages, they're usually in **readability** mode only. However, in the python programming language, indentation is essential.\n\n# Example:\n```python\nif(1 == 1):\n    print(\"Indents are important\")\n```\nExample of an error:\n```python\nif 10==10:\nprint(\"This does not work\")\n```\n", "# Variables\nWhat exactly is a variable? \n\nSimply put, it's a way to store information. In the case of python, there's no actual function or command to declare a variable. \n\nEvery single time you assign a value to a \"word\" or \"variable\" then the variable is created.\nExample:\n```python\nx = 1\nprint(x)\n```\nVariables, as you can see, do not need to be declared with any \"type\". Their \"type\" can be changed any time.\nExample:\n```python\nx = 1\nx \"Tree\"\nprint(x)\n```\n# How can we identify what type of variable are we dealing with?\nWell, it's quite simple. We use the **type()** function.There are four variable types that we will be looking at:\n* Strings\n* Integers\n* Floats\n* Booleans\n\n# Try it out here:\n```python\nsvar = \"Tree\"\nivar = 5\nfvar = 5.0\nbvar = True\nprint(type(svar))\nprint(type(ivar))\nprint(type(fvar))\nprint(type(bvar))\n```"]};
